# Artificial Neuron

An artificial neuron is the basic building block for a neural network. It
basically gets `N inputs`, applies `weights` to the `inputs`, and sums them to
produce an `output`.

There's also the idea of `bias`, which is added to the result of the `inputs`
such that it shifts the function towards the training data.
